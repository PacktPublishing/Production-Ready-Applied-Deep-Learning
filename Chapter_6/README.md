# Efficient Model Training

In this folder, we include two notebooks describing TensorFlow and PyTorch model training with multiple CPU and GPU devices.

* [Utilizing multiple devices for training TensorFlow Model](./TensorFlow.ipynb)
* [Utilizing multiple devices for training PyTorch Model](./PyTorch.ipynb)
