# Effective Planning of Deep Learning Driven Projects 

In this chapter, we will understand what Deep Learning (DL) is and how it is shaping our daily lives. Going further, we will learn the project execution process that is followed by the top-tier technology companies for DL projects. You will learn key concepts for project planning such as comprehension of business objectives, how to define appropriate evaluation metrics, stakeholders’ identification, resource planning, and the difference between Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Fully Featured Product (FFP).  

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to construct a DL project playbook which clearly describes the goal of the project, milestones, tasks, resource allocation, and timeline.
